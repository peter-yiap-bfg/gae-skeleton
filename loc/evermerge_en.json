  {
    "conversation.37.message2": "Er... is that a thing?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.37.message3": "Yep. My research shows that 100% of stepmothers are affected by Wicked Stepmotheritis."
  },
  {
    "conversation.37.message4": "Woah! You betcha, Princess. I'll be there."
  },
  {
    "conversation.37.message5": "Perfect! And you can help us find more baskets!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.38.message1": "Hey Princess... we're happy to collect baskets for this fundraiser, but how do WE know we don't have Wicked Stepmotheritis?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.38.message2": "Well... have you felt the urge to poison one or more new stepdaughters?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.38.message3": "No..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.38.message4": "Then you've got nothing to worry about!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.38.message5": "We need to keep merging so we can find our guest of honor!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.39.message1": "Welcome, Red Riding Hood! Your baskets were such a treat!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.39.message2": "IS THAT A WOLF? Get it away from me!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.39.message3": "A... what? Sweetie, it's just a fluffy Kitty!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.39.message4": "I'm not sure which one of you insulted me more."
  },
  {
    "conversation.39.message5": "Oh, thank goodness! I hate wolves. How can I help? Do you need something delivered?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.40.message1": "Just a few more planks and this'll make a fine home!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.40.message2": "WHAT?! No gnome could leave YOUR house looking like this, Mr. Bunyan. We're on it!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.41.message1": "Now we're getting somewhere! What do you think of the new toilets, Mr. Bunyan?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.41.message2": "Erm... They're real nice, boys! But I'm used to making do in the great outdoors."
  },
  {
    "conversation.41.message3": "But... they're HEATED! *whispers* He doesn't like them, Buck."
  },
  {
    "conversation.41.message4": "The answer is always more amenities!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.42.message1": "Fantastic! What do you think of the new surround sound system, Mr. Bunyan?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.42.message2": "When you put on this bird song, doesn't it feel like you're SURROUNDED by nature?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.42.message3": "But we're already surrounded by nature! Honestly, no need to make a fuss over me. I love it all!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.42.message4": "He got surround sound? What am I, chopped liver?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.43.message1": "Now we're cooking! Mr. Bunyan, what do you think of the new whirlpool tub?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.43.message2": "Well..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.43.message3": "Oh no."
  },
  {
    "conversation.43.message4": "It's nice! I just prefer a plunge in the Great Lakes. You ever been? Made them myself."
  },
  {
    "conversation.43.message5": "Chuck, I have an idea for an upgrade... But we're going to need a bucket. A big bucket. And more wagons!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.44.message1": "A-a-achoo! Who planted sunflowers INSIDE my wagon? I'm allergic!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.44.message2": "*whispers* Abort Mission Sunny Side Up, I repeat... abort Mission Sunny Side Up."
  },
  {
    "conversation.44.message3": "Roger that, Buck."
  },
  {
    "conversation.44.message4": "Let's keep looking for more wagons! I bet a new idea will just pop up!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.45.message1": "VOILA! We present... an in-home gym! Stay fit as a fiddle, from the comfort of home."
  },
  {
    "conversation.45.message2": "Wow, so thoughtful! I just..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.45.message3": "Don't tell us... you 'prefer hiking in the fresh mountain air.'"
  },
  {
    "conversation.45.message4": "Has anyone seen Puss in Boots? I saw him head this way! Strange..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.46.message1": "Hey, where's Sleeping Beauty? I just found Puss in Boots..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.46.message2": "He's holed up in my bathroom. Said something about treating himself?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.46.message3": "Come to think of it, he was wearing my robe."
  },
  {
    "conversation.46.message4": "Psst... gnomes. I have a few ideas for renovations that might interest you."
  },
  {
    "conversation.46.message5": "Mr. Bunyan will love them! We just need a few more wagons..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.47.message1": "Welcome home! What do you think, Mr. Bunyan? Do you like the new scratching post we included?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.47.message2": "We even added a giant sandbox! Just like you asked for!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.47.message3": "Wow, thanks! I didn't ask for any of that, though."
  },
  {
    "conversation.47.message4": "What?! Why we ouhgta..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.47.message5": "Chuck, I smell a rat! I think we got swindled by the cat."
  },
  {
    "conversation.47.message6": "You think Puss in Boots got to the stove?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.48.message1": "YOWL! How dare you humiliate me like this, Princess! No one tugs at my collar!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.48.message2": "Stop loitering at Paul's house, it's not yours! Now, if you're a good Kitty, I'll let you play with some yarn."
  },
  {
    "conversation.48.message3": "Ohhh yarn! I do love to... no! Cease with your trickery!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.48.message4": "Think, Chuck! What would a flannel-wearing hero who loves oatmeal want in his house?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.49.message1": "By gum, I've think I've got it! Let's get back to work!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.49.message2": "I love it. It's perfect! How did ya know I needed one of these, gnomes?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.49.message3": "A state-of-the-art bowling alley in your basement?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.49.message4": "No... this cupholder. And in my favorite armchair! There's no place like home, am I right, boys?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.49.message5": "*whispers* I think he means the hole we accidentally cut during renovations."
  },
  {
    "conversation.49.message6": "Anything for you, Mr. Bunyan."
  },
  {
    "conversation.50.message1": "Wonderous! I love the smell of fresh coral in the morning. "
  },
  {
    "conversation.51.message1": "Now it really feels like home!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.51.message2": "Maybe if we keep digging around for coral we'll find buried treasure?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.52.message1": "Hooray, more coral! I think I need to throw a houswarming party to celebrate. Gnomes, could you help set up?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.52.message2": "Will there be lawn games? We're big on lawns."
  },
  {
    "conversation.53.message1": "What else do we need for my housewarming party? Treats, maybe? Fresh sardines always go over well!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.53.message2": "Finally, someone with taste!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.53.message3": "Hmm... It's too quiet in here. We must fix that!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.54.message1": "Excellent job, gnomes! Just testing out some music for the housewarming party now. What do you think? Isn't it beautiful?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.54.message2": "Is that the sound of something dying?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.54.message3": "No silly, it's the barking of seals at sunrise! So soothing."
  },
  {
    "conversation.55.message1": "There's some sort of growth outside my door... is that supposed to be there?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.55.message2": "Um. That's grass, Princess. It comes pretty standard here."
  },
  {
    "conversation.55.message3": " 'Grass.' What an odd word."
  },
  {
    "conversation.56.message1": "Oh, wow! This place is beautiful! It's just looking a bit empty... how about some decorations for the housewarming?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.56.message2": "I did pick up this FANTASTIC strand of kelp the other day! "
  },
  {
    "conversation.57.message1": "This new home is ALMOST perfect! Now we just need a ballroom."
  },
  {
    "conversation.57.message2": "A ballroom? Like for dancing? With... legs?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.57.message3": "Of course, silly!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.57.message4": "*whispers* Do you want to tell her or should I, Chuck?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.58.message1": "Hey Princess, where should we put these gadgets and gizmos and thingamabobs? The new basement?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.58.message2": "What do you think I am, some kind of garbage collector? Recyle them!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.58.message3": "You don't even want the fork? Okay, then..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.58.message4": "Just a few more touches left to make before this home is complete! If only Papa could see me now. Living on land with the humans!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.59.message1": "It's beautiful! It's like Papa always said, a school of fish in the mouth of a whale is two hammerheads waiting to strike!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.59.message2": "*whispers* Does anyone know what that means?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.59.message3": "I love my new land home! This terrible fog can't stop us if we work together!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.60.message1": "Oh... a hairbrush! I know someone quite keen on hair products... can't shut up about them, actually."
  },
  {
    "conversation.60.message2": "Let's find more and find out who!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.61.message1": "Another brush... lovely."
  },
  {
    "conversation.61.message2": "You don't sound too happy about that, Princess."
  },
  {
    "conversation.61.message3": "No, of course I am! Why wouldn't I be happy about finding more perfect stupid royal combs?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.61.message4": "*whispers* Seems like she's in a bad mood... let's get back to work."
  },
  {
    "conversation.62.message1": "Huzzah! I'm the Lord of Hairbrushes!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.62.message2": "More like the Lord of Hardly Washes! Now back to work."
  },
  {
    "conversation.63.message1": "Wow! This one's shiny. And smells great."
  },
  {
    "conversation.63.message2": "I don't know. Smells kind of like swamp to me."
  },
  {
    "conversation.63.message3": "Uh... is something wrong, Princess?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.63.message4": "No! Nothing's wrong! Keeping finding combs... if you must."
  },
  {
    "conversation.64.message1": "Chuck, have you noticed our brushes mysteriously disappearing?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.64.message2": "You know what they say! Hair today, gone tomorrow..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.65.message1": "How many more of these do we need?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.65.message2": "I'm counting: 32 of the small, 25 with the handle, carry the seven..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.65.message3": "Stop! You're making my head spin. How about you make like an axe and get back to chopping!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.65.message4": "But... I'm a gnome, not an axe..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.66.message1": "Holy cannoli... Princess, have YOU been hoarding the combs?! We found a stash in your living room."
  },
  {
    "conversation.66.message2": "I confess! It's me! I've been stealing your brushes! "
  },
  {
    "conversation.66.message3": "I'm shocked! And stunned! Aghast, too!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.66.message4": "I'm so sorry, my gnomish friends... it's just... Well, you'll see why when we finish merging these."
  },
  {
    "conversation.67.message1": "Helloooo world! Oh, it's you. Did you finally cave in and accept my makeover offer?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.67.message2": "Those ends need... help."
  },
  {
    "conversation.67.message3": "No, actually! We're just here clearing out all this fog and saving the Kingdom, if you haven't noticed!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.67.message4": "Sorry. Haven't. I'm too distracted by all the bad hair I'm seeing."
  },
  {
    "conversation.67.message5": "Does she come with an off button?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.68.message1": "An anchor! Oh, how wonderful!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.68.message2": "Perhaps it belongs to a pirate... that would be delightful!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.69.message1": "Yuck! An anchor. I bet it belongs to a dirty pirate. "
  },
  {
    "conversation.69.message2": "Excuse you! Pirates are noble caretakers of the sea!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.69.message3": "A mermaid WOULD say that. Go ahead, follow the anchors and find out yourself."
  },
  {
    "conversation.70.message1": "What an elegant anchor! Ah, and it smells just like home."
  },
  {
    "conversation.70.message2": "Or like a dirty scoundrel pirate."
  },
  {
    "conversation.70.message3": "Enough! Surely not everyone feels as you do about pirates. Perhaps we should take a poll?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.71.message1": "This anchor is so beautiful... just like your hair, Rapunzel!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.71.message2": "Do you need something?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.71.message3": "Well... Peter and I are taking a poll. What are your thoughts on pirates?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.71.message4": "Style: good. Puffy sleeves are hot right now. Hygiene: terrible. It's a draw."
  },
  {
    "conversation.71.message5": "Hmm. Maybe a few more anchors will help sort this out..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.72.message1": "Doesn't this anchor make you think of pirates? "
  },
  {
    "conversation.72.message2": "Not this particular one, no."
  },
  {
    "conversation.72.message3": "Well, whatever. We're taking a poll. Do you like pirates, yes or no?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.72.message4": "Depends. Do they have treasure?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.72.message5": "I'm going to put you down as a 'no'."
  },
  {
    "conversation.73.message1": "So far I have 1 neutral, 1 yes, and 1 raspberry sound on the do-we-like pirates poll. And more anchors!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.73.message2": "I'm just supposed to trust your results? You're a mermaid!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.73.message3": "Rude! Admittedly, some of my cousins haven't always been the nicest to humans..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.74.message1": "What a high-quality anchor! Someone must have spent a lot of money on it."
  },
  {
    "conversation.74.message2": "Yeah, I bet a dirty pirate DID spend a lot of stolen coin on it."
  },
  {
    "conversation.74.message3": "Oh, will you quit it?! Let's keep merging and see which one of us is right!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.75.message1": "Ahoy! To what do I owe this great honor?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.75.message2": "I knew it! It's not a pirate, it's Sinbad!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.75.message3": "Hey! I recognize you. I LOVED your show."
  },
  {
    "conversation.75.message4": "What? You must be mistaken. I'm Sinbad the Sailor, the Great Adventurer, Conquerer of the Seas!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.75.message5": "Three capitalized titles? Overkill much?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.76.message1": "You know what would make this work go faster?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.76.message2": "Oh! I know! A TIME MACHINE."
  },
  {
    "conversation.76.message3": "No... I call it the Merge 5 Bonus!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.76.message4": "When you merge 5 items, you get a bonus item of the next level! Every fogging time!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.76.message5": "So you're saying it's a 20% improvement of the proletariat's efficiency... It's no time machine, but I'll bite."
  },
  {
    "conversation.77.message1": "People tell me I have a sweet tooth... They're not wrong. Let me show you some delicious candy magic!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.78.message1": "Woah! Somebody's been hiding chests in trees."
  },
  {
    "conversation.78.message2": "Let's open it! There might be useful goodies inside."
  },
  {
    "conversation.79.message1": "Let's see what else we can discover!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.79.message2": "Magic is everywhere in the land of EverMerge!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.80.message1": "In the land of EverMerge, every discovery is just a merge or two away!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.80.message2": "Go ahead! We can do it!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.81.message1": "Surprisingly, these gnomes are fantastic lumberjacks!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.81.message2": "Oh, you're just flattering us! Please... don't let us stop you."
  },
  {
    "conversation.82.message1": "Oh no... candy tree season is over! No matter, there are other delicious ingredients in the land of EverMerge!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.82.message2": "Meowrvelous! Maybe we can find some sardine-growing trees now?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.83.message1": "Wheat flowering season is over already?! Time flies when you're having fun!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.83.message2": "I can't WHEAT to see what ingredients we find next!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.84.message1": "Apple picking season is over! I didn't even get to tell my apple joke. Hey Buck, how do you make an apple turnover?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.84.message2": "How?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.84.message3": "Push it down a hill!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.85.message1": "Carrot growing season is over! I wonder what new ingredients we'll find next!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.85.message2": "Can we add cioppino to the menu yet?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.86.message1": "That's enough stones to start building."
  },
  {
    "conversation.86.message2": "As my friends the Little Pigs always say, go stone or don't go home. Seriously, there might be a wolf around."
  },
  {
    "conversation.87.message1": "A few more stones and this will be a stalwart fortification!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.87.message2": "What about additional escape routes? One can never be too careful."
  },
  {
    "conversation.87.message3": "Erm... we can add some more exits?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.88.message1": "Behold! What do you think, Puss in Boots? We added those emergency exits you asked about. There's even some trap doors!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.88.message2": "Hmm. Perhaps it needs some sort of defense system? Are lasers in the budget?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.88.message3": "Should we be worried?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.89.message1": "So, update on the renovation: we couldn't get the lasers you wanted, but we did put in some scary-looking gargoyles."
  },
  {
    "conversation.89.message2": "Not ideal, but I'll make it work. Every great Kingdom should have an intimidating stone keep! Can we add a moat?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.89.message3": "We'll see what we can do..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.90.message1": "Check it out! Waiting on a few permits for the moat install, but we did set up a fishline with some bells around the perimeter..?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.90.message2": "Oh! Bells! I love playing with bells! Ahem, I mean, perfect. Yes, that seems like it should hold up."
  },
  {
    "conversation.90.message3": "Against... what?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.91.message1": "Those flowers are so beautiful! Almost as beautiful as my hair."
  },
  {
    "conversation.92.message1": "Achoo! Are all these flowers necessary? Or maybe it's all the hair products I'm allergic to!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.92.message2": "You know, I have a friend who's allergic to cats. So, like, maybe you're allergic to yourself?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.92.message3": "Hilarious! Well, at least I've never been trapped in a tower by some old grandma!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.93.message1": "Oh, how wonderful! A sweet little drum. I'm sure I've seen this somewhere before."
  },
  {
    "conversation.94.message1": "Pa rum pum bop ba! I love a good drum beat, don't you Chuck?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.94.message2": "I would believe you if you were drumming to any discernible rhythm."
  },
  {
    "conversation.94.message3": "Exsqueeze me? We have rhythm in spades!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.94.message4": "Oh? I bet I can drum better than you. Perhaps this calls for a drum-off?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.95.message1": "Folks, we're gathering more drums for the drum-off! Everyone's invited!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.95.message2": "Lovely! Just like our annual Squid Bounce at home! Admittedly, it was quite a bit more inky."
  },
  {
    "conversation.95.message3": "Something tells me it's not at all like that."
  },
  {
    "conversation.96.message1": "How are you feeling about this drum challenge against the gnomes, Puss in Boots? Training going okay?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.96.message2": "Training? All I need is the rhythm in my bones!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.96.message3": "For I am Puss in Boots, master swordsman and... legendary drummer!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.96.message4": "A cat drumming? I swear I saw a video on the internet about this once."
  },
  {
    "conversation.97.message1": "Great new drums, gnomes! How are you feeling before the big drum-off against Puss in Boots, boys?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.97.message2": "We're feeling strong! Limber! Raring to go!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.97.message3": "And we're building a team of the best drums behind us! These drums are giving it 110 percent!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.98.message1": "All right, folks... Welcome to EverMerge's first-ever drumming battle!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.98.message2": "In one corner we have... Puss in Boots! He once put on a pair of boots, the rest is history!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.98.message3": "In the other corner... our favorite gnomes! Three-time tree-chopping EverMerge champions!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.98.message4": "Let's have a good, clean, drum-off. Ready everyone?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.99.message1": "We're in the middle of the drumming challenge, folks! The drums are getting bigger and louder!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.99.message2": "Wait a second... I'm hearing that our participants have just gotten a bad arm cramp."
  },
  {
    "conversation.99.message3": "They're checking the tapes... It's a tie between Puss in Boots and the gnomes! Maybe our special guest will weigh in?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.100.message1": "What's with all the banging drums? Can't a boy be stuck in cursed fog in peace?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.100.message2": "You missed one heck of a drum-off!"

  {
    "conversation.111.message2": "Are you... talking to that mirror?"

  },
  {
    "conversation.111.message4": "Of course I do! I'm just... rusty. So, what is it saying, then? Anything good?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.111.message5": "Says fame and fortune awaits you! But only if you start giving back. Got any extra coin?"

  },
  {
    "conversation.114.message1": "Ah, Puss in Boots! Curious to know what this mirror has to say? It just so happens that I can speak..."

    "conversation.122.message1": "What on earth is that sound coming from the house?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.122.message2": "That? Why, it is a recording of a lion's roar. Intimidating, isn't it?"

  },
  {
    "conversation.126.message2": "Do we have the rights for that kind of crossover?"

  {
    "conversation.126.message3": "We'll need a secret base to operate our investigation! And a wall where we can put up sticky notes and draw lines between them! "
  },
  {
    "conversation.127.message1": "We've gathered more moon rock samples, but your testimony will help get to the bottom of this incident."
  },
  {
    "conversation.127.message2": "Care to elaborate on your alien encounter, Paul?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.127.message3": "You're recording this? Oh, okay, you betcha. Well... I was doing a little gardening."
  },
  {
    "conversation.127.message4": "Everything went fuzzy and bright and the alien was right there plain as day! When I came to again, it was gone."
  },
  {
    "conversation.128.message1": "We have more moon rocks, but still no evidence of aliens! Confounding."
  },
  {
    "conversation.128.message2": "Where is the truth! Is the truth here or there?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.128.message3": "I would like the truth anywhere!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.129.message1": "Perfect! Our new forensics area will run tests on these moon rocks and see if anything's amiss."
  },
  {
    "conversation.129.message2": "One step ahead of you: I just analyzed them. They are rocks."
  },
  {
    "conversation.129.message3": "We can't rule anything out, Kitty! Are you grumpy over your litter box again?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.129.message4": "Do not speak about my litter box in public!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.130.message1": "These moon rocks can only tell us so much. What else do you remember about your alien encounter, Paul? "
  },
  {
    "conversation.130.message2": "Did it seem to enjoy bike rides? Did it ever use the word 'Exterminate'? Was it from a parallel underworld?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.130.message3": "No! None of that stuff! Wow, you know a lot about aliens."
  },
  {
    "conversation.130.message4": "I am telling you, he probably just ate something rotten."
  },
  {
    "conversation.131.message1": "I'm so glad we installed this new coffee machine! Now we can really have an investigative montage."
  },
  {
    "conversation.132.message1": "Is a medical exam really necessary? Can't we just keep collecting more moon rocks, follow the trail...?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.132.message2": "You said you had an encounter! We have to be sure you aren't implanted with alien technology, Paul!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.132.message3": "Trust no one!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.133.message1": "Wow! My new place rocks! Ha, get it? Wait, what's everyone doing here?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.133.message2": "We're investigating Paul's alien encounter! Did you see anything? Why are you laughing?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.133.message3": "All he encountered was a rock to the head! I was practicing my pitch and he got in the way."
  },
  {
    "conversation.133.message4": "Come to think of it... I do remember a high-pitched cackle as everything went dark. I thought it was how they talked!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.133.message5": "See? What did I tell you."
  },
  {
    "conversation.134.message1": "Sweet! A moon mine! We can use it to get more moon rocks so I can stop sleeping on Paul's couch."
  },
  {
    "conversation.134.message2": "He's way too much of a morning person."
  },
  {
    "conversation.135.message1": "Aha, a ship mine! Looks like we'll be able to get everything in shipshape here in no time."
  },
  {
    "conversation.135.message2": "You're proud of yourself for that one, aren't you?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.136.message1": "Finally! A flower mine!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.136.message2": "That's a thing? Can we make organic cosmetics from the flowers? They're big right now."
  },
  {
    "conversation.136.message3": "Um... Let's just start and see how it works."
  },
  {
    "conversation.137.message1": "That's enough acorns to start building!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.137.message2": "Wow! My very own home. I wonder what living without Grandmother will be like."
  },
  {
    "conversation.138.message1": "I love how the new house is coming along, Red! Hey, what's the matter?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.138.message2": "I've never lived alone before! I don't know if I'll like it."
  },
  {
    "conversation.138.message3": "Nonsense! You know what would be the perfect way to celebrate...? A SLEEPOVER!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.138.message4": "Once I held one that lasted years! 100 years. Okay, I was actually just asleep... that's beside the point."
  },
  {
    "conversation.139.message1": "Welcome to the first official sleepover at Red's house!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.139.message2": "How marvelous! What games shall we play? Swing the Jellyfish was always a childhood favorite."
  },
  {
    "conversation.139.message3": "Uh... how about Truth or Dare? You'll both love it!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.140.message1": "Okay, Red, time to celebrate your new place! Ready to play your first Truth or Dare? It's the perfect sleepover fare."
  },
  {
    "conversation.140.message2": "*gulp* Yes... um, dare?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.140.message3": "I dare you to... put chocolate syrup on a pickle and eat it!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.140.message4": "WHAT?! I could never! Grandmother always said no sweets after 7pm. And never on a pickle!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.141.message1": "All right, I think I understand how to play this 'Truth or Dare' game now... "
  },
  {
    "conversation.141.message2": "Red, I dare you to... go outside and do the Kraken Crawl!!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.141.message3": "Mermaid, nobody's ever heard of that."
  },
  {
    "conversation.141.message4": "Also, I could NEVER! Grandmother says dancing is for ding-dongs trying to sell you something."
  },
  {
    "conversation.142.message1": "Okay, let's keep this sleepover on track! We have GOT to find a dare you can do, Red. Hmm..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.142.message2": "I dare you to... put used dishes in the sink without rinsing them first?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.142.message3": "ARE YOU INSANE? Grandmother says that's how you ruin a dish! You always rinse!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.143.message1": "*whispers* Between you and me, this sleepover with Red isn't going so well."
  },
  {
    "conversation.143.message2": "Is this not what all sleepovers on land are like? Is it time to play Sharks and Whales yet?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.144.message1": "Are you sure you're having fun? This whole sleepover was to celebrate your new home!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.144.message2": "I am, promise!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.144.message3": "How about a new dare, then? I dare you to... skip brushing your teeth before bedtime!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.144.message4": "NEVER! Grandmother says only freeloaders don't brush their teeth before bedtime."
  },
  {
    "conversation.145.message1": "Red, we've whittled down all the dares you won't do because of your Grandmother... so let's try something new!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.145.message2": "I dare you to... not listen to your Grandmother for once!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.145.message3": "I don't understand the dare. Is this a joke?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.145.message4": "Oh for fog's sake..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.146.message1": "Forget Truth or Dare. Your new house is tailormade to you! What about we just make friendship bracelets to celebrate?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.146.message2": "Well... Grandmother does always say a woman's hand is what holds together the world!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.146.message3": "So, I think she'd like it if we decorated them!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.146.message4": "Finally! Now you can really settle into this place!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.147.message1": "Achoo! We can't go on like this! Your flowers are going to be the death of me."
  },
  {
    "conversation.147.message2": "You have 8 other lives, don't you?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.147.message3": "Why I oughta..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.148.message1": "Ohhh! The flowers around here totally remind me of a bouquet I once put together for Beast."
  },
  {
    "conversation.148.message2": "For Beauty? How lovely!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.148.message3": "You'd think! He just kept going on and on about roses. Roses this, roses that, blah blah blah. Like, there's all kinds of flowers out there you know?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.148.message4": "I heard Beauty doesn't even LIKE roses..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.149.message1": "What do you think of my renovations, Paul? Don't you just LOVE my new yoga studio?!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.149.message2": "Err... you betcha. Seems real peaceful in here."
  },
  {
    "conversation.149.message3": "Like I always say, got to keep your mind, body, and spirit cleansed. Also, limber enough to climb down a tower."
  },
  {
    "conversation.150.message1": "Rapunzel, I was looking at the blueprints for the place... you're sure you wanted an 'all charcoal room' added?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.150.message2": "Duh! Charcoal is a detoxifier. Can't you just feel the toxins flowing right out of you when you walk in?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.150.message3": "*whispers* Buck, what does a toxin look like?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.151.message1": "Oh, hello Sleeping Beauty. Funny you should stop by. The gnomes just installed the hair salon, finally going to let me give that 'do a whirl?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.151.message2": "What's so wrong with my hair?!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.151.message3": "If you have to ask..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.152.message1": "Check it out, everyone! This is where the MAGIC happens... my studio. The lighting in here is great, right?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.152.message2": "Rapunzel, none of the photos you're showing us look anything like you."
  },
  {
    "conversation.152.message3": "Excuse me? My 1.2 million followers would disagree with you. People LOVE my hair inspiration posts!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.152.message4": "It's true, I've gotten some great beard tips."
  },
  {
    "conversation.153.message1": "Puss in Boots?! Is that you? You're so... fluffy! And polished?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.153.message2": "It sure is! AND he smells like Bouquet of Towers. It's my signature scent, too."
  },
  {
    "conversation.153.message3": "She tricked me into a makeover! You might have won the battle, Princess Hairspray, but the war is still ahead..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.153.message4": "Yeah, whatever. On that note, my place is officially open for makeover montages! Any takers?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.154.message1": "Canvas rolls! Perfect. A few more of these and I can start building my tent up again."
  },
  {
    "conversation.155.message1": "There's only one thing that could make this place better: Charging admission!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.155.message2": "Attention EverMerge residents: come one, come all! Pinocchio's Amazing Circus of Fear is open!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.155.message3": "Do you dare enter and reveal your biggest fear?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.156.message1": "The Circus of Fear seems scary, but... I've got a basket to deliver, and it's the fastest route through!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.156.message2": "AHHHH!!! Make it stop!!!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.156.message3": "Your biggest fear... is your Grandmother? I thought it was wolves?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.156.message4": "You've never seen Grandmother when she's watching her stories and gets interrupted."
  },
  {
    "conversation.157.message1": "A circus tent! How quaint."
  },
  {
    "conversation.157.message2": "It's not just any circus... it's the Amazing Circus of Fear! Step right up. What do you see?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.157.message3": "Oh my fog!!! It's me, but I don't have legs!!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.157.message4": "*whispers* Seriously, should someone tell her?"

  {
    "conversation.158.message2": "Oh jeez, well I was just passing through, but I'll take a gander!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.158.message3": "UFF DA! SPIDERS!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.158.message4": "Really? But they're so... tiny."
  },
  {
    "conversation.158.message5": "With four times the number of legs!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.159.message1": "Welcome to the Circus of Fear, Sleeping Beauty! Do you dare enter?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.159.message2": "Circus of what now? Well, I suppose! Why not? You seem very proud of it!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.159.message3": "AHHH!!! It's an office kitchen. But there's only one coffee machine for everyone to share..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.159.message4": "Worst of all, it's DECAF."
  },
  {
    "conversation.160.message1": "A circus! Nice. Do you have those motorcycles that jump through hoops of fire? I'm into those."
  },
  {
    "conversation.160.message2": "Er... not exactly. See for yourself! If you dare..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.160.message3": "WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FOG. What kind of sick person would have a room full of tax returns?! I'm out of here!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.161.message1": "What do we have here, Buck? *squints* Sign says it's the CIRCUS OF FEAR... cool. Let's go in!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.161.message2": "I REGRET THIS DECISION IMMEDIATELY. It's just Mr. Bunyan standing in a corner telling me how disappointed he is in me!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.161.message3": "I haven't felt so disappointing since we last visited Ma."
  },
  {
    "conversation.162.message1": "We've all been talking about this little circus you have going, and we want our money back! You tricked us!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.162.message2": "Yes, I haven't been able to face Grandmother in days!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.162.message3": "No refunds, sorry. It's in the fine print."

  },
  {
    "conversation.163.message4": "What? Is that a thing? You're working for Pinocchio??"
  },
  {
    "conversation.163.message5": "What can I say? The Circus of Fear is a lucrative gig, and business is booming!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.164.message1": "The Circus of Fear is unstoppable! How will we ever fight against it?!"
  },
  {

  },

  },
  {
    "conversation.198.message1": "There's something odd about these... In the whole ocean, I haven't seen a single pirate with an anchor like it!"

  },
  {
    "conversation.200.message2": "Hear what?"

  {
    "conversation.201.message3": "It said I'd find fame and fortune if I donated some coins to Pinocchio! And still nothing!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.201.message4": "Really?! It said I was losing my hair! Wait a second... something smells fishy here. The puppet boy can't lie... can he?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.202.message1": "More mirrors! Where's Pinocchio? He must be close by..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.202.message2": "You rang?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.202.message3": "You lied to us! You don't speak mirror at all, do you?! Where are my coins?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.202.message4": "You should know better than that! I can't lie. However, I HAVE learned a few loopholes over the years..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.203.message1": "After closer inspection and following the protocols of the Northern Gnome Axe Guild we have determined that this mirror, in fact, cannot speak."
  },
  {
    "conversation.203.message2": "So if Pinocchio says he can talk to mirrors... does that mean reads mirror minds? I've never met a mirror-pathic before!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.203.message3": "Chuck... that's not... no."
  },
  {
    "conversation.204.message1": "Hmm... I wonder if I could use these heels to climb down a tower wall?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.204.message2": "You know what I always say... make it beautiful AND functional for escaping evil witches! "
  },
  {
    "conversation.205.message1": "What a lovely watering can! Perhaps we can finally get that community garden going?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.206.message1": "You dare attack me with a spray bottle?! En garde!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.206.message2": "Calm down, Kitty! It's just a watering can. I'm working on our community garden! Want to help?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.206.message3": "Perhaps... I have a few ideas that need planting."
  },
  {
    "conversation.207.message1": "Uh... Mermaid? What are you doing?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.207.message2": "Is this not how you plant things in a land garden?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.207.message3": "Usually you use the watering can on the PLANTS... not yourself."
  },
  {
    "conversation.207.message4": "Oh! Hmm. I suppose that does make sense. But it's so refreshing!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.208.message1": "Another watering can! Now we're really getting this garden going. But who's planting all these beanstalks?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.208.message2": "Oh, those? Don't worry about those..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.209.message1": "WATCH IT!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.209.message2": "AHH! Whose idea was it to plant this extremely aggressive willow?! It nearly took my head off!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.209.message3": "Well, ex-CUUUUSE-me! You were the one that said we could all use a watering can to plant something!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.209.message4": "I just like a tree with some attitude."
  },
  {
    "conversation.210.message1": "This community garden is just perfect to grow ingredients for Grandmother's cactus pudding recipe!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.210.message2": "That sounds like a... prickly situation."
  },
  {
    "conversation.211.message1": "What do ya all think of the redwood I planted? She's a beauty, isn't she? That watering can sure is powerful!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.211.message2": "Paul, I love the enthusiasm, but it's taking up all the space! It's a COMMUNITY garden."
  },
  {
    "conversation.211.message3": "Not as much space as all the beanstalks someone keeps planting everywhere!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.212.message1": "Anyone seen a cricket in this garden? I've got a bone to pick with an old friend."
  },
  {
    "conversation.212.message2": "Have you tried singing to locate your non-human friends? It always works for me!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.212.message3": "No. *shudders* I don't do that anymore."
  },

    "conversation.213.message1": "Puss in Boots... did you just climb down from that beanstalk?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.213.message2": "No, who? What?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.213.message3": "What's in your hands?! Is that a bag of coins? And a HEN?!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.213.message4": "What? Yes, they're mine! And on a completely unrelated note that has nothing to do with these coins or hen..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.213.message5": "*gigantic growling in the distance* It might be a good idea to cut down those beanstalks now."
  },
  {
    "conversation.214.message1": "Hello again, dearies! My, my, look at this garden. Did you all work on this one? It's quite... creative."
  },
  {
    "conversation.214.message2": "Thumbelina! We're so pleased to see you again. We missed your decorative vision!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.214.message3": "Is that *eye twitches* a patch of daisies next to the roses? No, no... we can't have that. Not at all."
  },
  {
    "conversation.214.message4": "I see my work here has just begun!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.215.message1": "Even the smallest buds can bloom into mighty building blocks! My new place will be up and running in no time!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.216.message1": "What a charming little pond! Oh, my... is that muck?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.216.message2": "It's just a little pond scum! Comes with the territory, m'am."
  },
  {
    "conversation.216.message3": "Oh, is that so? Be a dear and clean it up, will you?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.217.message1": "Nothing like the smell of garden getting installed in the morning! What do you think so far?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.217.message2": "Hmm... we'll need plenty more greenery than that, gnomes! In fact, double the amount. And triple the flowers!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.217.message3": "*whispers* She sure loves her greens."
  },
  {
    "conversation.218.message1": "How's the place coming along, Thumbelina? I wanted to welcome you to the neighborhood with some treats!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.218.message2": "A basket of treats? How quaint!  Hmm... I see you've brought... well, what are these?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.218.message3": "Lemon Bark Brownies! Lemon tree bark is delicious this time of year. Made them myself."
  },
  {
    "conversation.218.message4": "Ah, sounds... unique? I'll save them for a rainy day, thank you."
  },
  {
    "conversation.219.message1": "Excuse me, you there! Young man!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.219.message2": "Uh... yeah?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.219.message3": "As you can see, the grass is quite overrun. The gnomes left a mower right over there. Would you be a dear?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.219.message4": "What? You expect me to mow your lawn, lady?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.219.message5": "Don't you be fresh with ME, Peter! Now get to it. There's only so many hours in the day and we need to keep building!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.220.message1": "OUCH! What in the fog... Are these giant Venus flytraps?! One just tried to bite me!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.220.message2": "Are they alright?! Did you hurt them? Oh! My poor babies! That's Hazel and Earl, aren't they just beautiful?!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.220.message3": "Did I hurt THEM? I almost lost a finger!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.220.message4": "Well, I think they're cool. Maybe they just, like, bite people they don't like. You make a lot of loud noises, you know?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.221.message1": "Something smells delicious! What's cooking, Thumbelina?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.221.message2": "My specialty: Frog leg stew."
  },
  {
    "conversation.221.message3": "Frog legs? Ah. I uh, I'm more of a vegetarian myself."
  },
  {
    "conversation.221.message4": "Oh? My guests say it's hoppin' good."
  },
  {
    "conversation.222.message1": "What's that land plant you're growing in your garden, Thumbelina? The berries look delicious!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.222.message2": "Ah! I wouldn't eat those if I were you, dearie. They're poisonous unless mixed with a little chamomile. Want me to fix you a cup?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.222.message3": "Er... no thank you."
  },
  {
    "conversation.223.message1": "It's so nice for someone else with taste to be here! Mind sharing some house decorating tips?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.223.message2": "Of course, my dear! The first rule of settling in is simple: meet the neighbors. A friendly neighbor makes all the difference."
  },
  {
    "conversation.223.message3": "You're sure there's not a different option? Ugh."
  },
  {
    "conversation.224.message1": "Here's another tip for a new home: To add warmth and elegance to any room, just add some copper, brass, and silver pieces!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.224.message2": "Did someone say silver pieces?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.224.message3": "She's talking about decorations, Sinbad."
  },
  {
    "conversation.224.message4": "Ah, well. While I'm here, you do have a fine assortment of metals. Any up for sale? I'd cut you a great deal."
  },
  {
    "conversation.225.message1": "Now, the way to create a cozy space is with the right textures! I like to bring a little of the outdoors inside."
  },
  {
    "conversation.225.message2": "Ooooo! What kind of rug is this, Thumbelina? Some kind of fur?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.225.message3": "Oh, that? It's mole."
  },
  {
    "conversation.225.message4": "*whispers* That seems oddly specific."
  },
  {
    "conversation.226.message1": "Dearies, you've done such a wonderful job with the house! Now..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.226.message2": "Hmm, did someone *eye twitches* rearrange the vegetable patch?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.226.message3": "S-shouldn't the carrots go with the cauliflower? It's alphabetical order!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.226.message4": "NO YOU IDIO... *deep breath* Nevermind that. We all make mistakes! Some of us more than others... Let's get this fixed!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.227.message1": "It's absolutely perfect! What a wonderful new start in EverMerge!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.227.message2": "Now, anyone up for some tea?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.228.message1": "The birds are chirping, the flowers blooming, the bees buzzing... do you know what that means, my gnomish friends?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.228.message2": "A-a-choooo! Time to stock up on tissues?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.228.message3": "No, silly - spring is in the air! And I've thought up the perfect way to celebrate!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.228.message4": "We're finally getting that axe display case installed in the break room?!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.228.message5": "No... wait, what? We're going to merge our way to a very special springtime tree!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.229.message1": "Now what do we have here...? A wizard's hat?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.229.message2": "I wonder if there's some way to harness its magic... Hmmm, maybe I can build an app for that!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.230.message1": "Ouch! This ugly hat just zapped me!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.230.message2": "*snickers* You didn't know about the alarm system? It's magical. Genius, actually."
  },
  {
    "conversation.230.message3": "I'm guessing its owner didn't want anyone else's grubby hands on it."
  },
  {
    "conversation.230.message4": "Excuse me, puppet boy! I wouldn't be caught dead in this thing, anyway! It's WAY out of style. And smells a bit like old books."

  },
  {

  },
  {
    "conversation.237.message4": "No, but weirdly enough a sword in a big stone popped out. Sword will not come out of the stone, though. I already tried."
  },

  },
  {
    "conversation.239.message4": "Er... where, exactly?"
  },
  {

    "conversation.241.message2": "Trust me, I don't like it, either. But it's the safest building material!"
  },

  },
  {

  },
  {
    "conversation.244.message2": "At minimum. I have seven roommates and we've already tried the whole one-bathroom thing. It wasn't pretty."
  },

  },
  {
    "conversation.245.message2": "*peeks through curtains* Who are you? What are you holding?"

  {
    "conversation.245.message3": "It's a hot dish! Just wanted to welcome you to the neighborhood?"

    "conversation.247.message1": "Hello, Snow?! I've been knocking for ages! Maybe I could ask the gnomes to install a doorbell?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.247.message2": "Oh no, no, no. A certain seven someones don't want one installed..."

  },
  {
    "conversation.249.message2": "I call it the hub. All these little screens? They're camera feeds for eyes I've set up all over the house."
  },

  },
  {
    "conversation.250.message1": "WOWIE! Buck, have you seen Snow's axe collection? It's superb!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.250.message2": "Incredible! She even has the Wood Wrecker 3000. We didn't know you were such a collector of fine axes!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.250.message3": "One can never be too prepared. You wouldn't want to run into a huntsman without one, would you?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.250.message4": "Uh... no? *whispers* That's bad, right Buck?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.251.message1": "*knocks* Snow? You home? I've got a proposition for you!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.251.message2": "What is it, Sinbad? I've got a pantry to organize and some dwarves to wrangle."
  },
  {
    "conversation.251.message3": "I'm told you might be interested in some security gear. Well, do I have a deal for you! I'm running a special on a new alarm system."
  },

  },
  {
    "conversation.251.message5": "Go on, I'm listening..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.252.message1": "Uh... Snow? What are you looking at? *peers up* Are we playing a land game where we look at the sky?! How thrilling!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.252.message2": "No... it's not that. Didn't you just feel that?"
  },
  {
    "conversation.252.message3": "Feel what? It is a bit breezier than I'd prefer above water..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.252.message4": "No, it's like someone... combined things. And the house magically increased in size... Someone's watching us, I just know it!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.253.message1": "Anyone seen Sinbad? I have a bone to pick with him about the house alarm system he sold me! It's a piece of..."
  },
  {
    "conversation.253.message2": "Shhh! I'm looking for him too and don't want to scare him off!"
  },
  {
    "conversation.253.message3": "I bought a faulty set of loaded dice from him just last week. What's the world come to when you can't trust a guy to help you cheat?"
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "conversation.254.message2": "It's perfect, gnomes! Now we can start a whole new chapter in EverMerge... with a higher-end security system and equitable chore-sharing!"
  },
